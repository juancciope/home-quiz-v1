- Motivation: ${responses.motivation}
- Ideal Day: ${responses['ideal-day']}
- Success Vision: ${responses['success-vision']}
- Current Stage: ${responses['stage-level']}
- Success Definition: ${responses['success-definition']}

FUZZY ALIGNMENT SCORES:
- Touring Performer: ${fuzzyScores?.['touring-performer'] || 0}%

- Description: ${pathwayBlend?.description || 'Single pathway alignment'}
- Primary Path: ${pathwayBlend?.primary || 'touring-performer'}
- Secondary Path: ${pathwayBlend?.secondary || 'none'}

SCORING V2 FOCUS LEVELS (use for guidance):
${scoreResult ? `
- Touring Performer: ${scoreResult.levels['touring-performer']} (${Math.round(scoreResult.absPct['touring-performer'])}% absolute)
- Creative Artist: ${scoreResult.levels['creative-artist']} (${Math.round(scoreResult.absPct['creative-artist'])}% absolute)

- Blend Type: ${scoreResult.blendType}
- Stage Level: ${scoreResult.stageLevel}` : 'Not available'}

Based on these fuzzy scores, blend analysis, and focus levels, please provide a nuanced recommendation that:
1. Acknowledges their percentage alignments across all pathways
2. Provides strategies that blend their primary and secondary pathways if scores are close
3. Offers specific advice for balancing multiple interests
4. Creates action steps that serve multiple pathway alignments where possible

Do not box them into a single category - acknowledge their unique blend and provide guidance that honors their multi-faceted interests.`
