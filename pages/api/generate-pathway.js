RESPONSES:
- Motivation: ${responses.motivation}
- Ideal Day: ${responses['ideal-day']}
- Success Vision: ${responses['success-vision']}
- Current Stage: ${responses['stage-level']}
- Success Definition: ${responses['success-definition']}

FUZZY ALIGNMENT SCORES:
- Touring Performer: ${fuzzyScores?.['touring-performer'] || 0}%
- Creative Artist: ${fuzzyScores?.['creative-artist'] || 0}%
- Writer-Producer: ${fuzzyScores?.['writer-producer'] || 0}%

PATHWAY BLEND ANALYSIS:
- Type: ${pathwayBlend?.type || 'focused'}
- Description: ${pathwayBlend?.description || 'Single pathway alignment'}
- Primary Path: ${pathwayBlend?.primary || 'touring-performer'}
- Secondary Path: ${pathwayBlend?.secondary || 'none'}

SCORING V2 FOCUS LEVELS (use for guidance):
${scoreResult ? `
- Touring Performer: ${scoreResult.levels['touring-performer']} (${Math.round(scoreResult.absPct['touring-performer'])}% absolute)
- Creative Artist: ${scoreResult.levels['creative-artist']} (${Math.round(scoreResult.absPct['creative-artist'])}% absolute)

Based on these fuzzy scores, blend analysis, and focus levels, please provide a nuanced recommendation that:
1. Acknowledges their percentage alignments across all pathways
2. Provides strategies that blend their primary and secondary pathways if scores are close
3. Offers specific advice for balancing multiple interests
4. Creates action steps that serve multiple pathway alignments where possible

IMPORTANT - For HOME Resources, generate unique, specific resources for EACH step of their journey:
- Generate 6-8 unique resources for each pathway that are specifically tailored to the step and pathway
- For Touring Performer: Focus on rehearsal spaces, sound equipment, stage presence coaching, booking connections
- For Creative Artist: Focus on content creation studios, brand development, social media strategy, collaboration network
- For Writer-Producer: Focus on professional recording studios, industry equipment, collaboration network, music business education

Make sure resources are NOT recycled between steps - each step should have its own specific, relevant HOME resources.

IMPORTANT - For Company Recommendations:
Based on the user's primary pathway and stage level, select 4-6 companies from the following list that would be most valuable for them to know about at their current level.
