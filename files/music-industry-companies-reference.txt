As an artist grows, they typically move from self-booking local gigs (using tools like GigSalad or DIY networks), to getting picked up by an indie agent (e.g. High Road), to eventually signing with a major agency (CAA/WME/UTA) and plugging into the Live Nation or AEG machine for global touring. Every step of the way, delivering great live shows and building a fanbase will attract these bigger companies to your team.)
